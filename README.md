# AI Powered to detect and prevent CyberSecurity Threat

#People's Use
Most of the people uses social media where the download any kind of unauthorized images and from unauthorized people this may lead to any hack so our project acts as an intermediate platform between social media's and user where it checks the image with any kind of malicious links are present and also additional feature of network intrusions and maps

#How does it differ from existing
Most of the social media platform don't check any links or contents instead they focus mostly of encryption of images after decryption the images can be sent via our platform and our platform checks for data encryption and also for network intrusions and attackers location

## Overview
This project integrates **AI-powered cybersecurity and image security** techniques to detect **network intrusions and malicious hidden data in images**. The system is built using **CNN for steganography detection** and **LSTM-RNN for intrusion detection** using the **CIC-IDS dataset**. If an attack is detected, the system will **plot the attacker's location**.

## Features
- **OCR-Based Link Detection**: Extracts text from images to identify potential malicious links.
- **Steganography Detection**: Uses **CNN architecture** to determine if an image contains hidden data.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Uses **LSTM-RNN** to analyze network traffic and detect attacks from the **CIC-IDS2017 dataset**.
- **Attack Visualization**: Plots attacker locations on a real-time map using IP geolocation.
- **Streamlit Web UI**: A simple and interactive user interface for image and network security analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning:**
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for steganography detection.
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNN** for network intrusion detection.
- **Machine Learning:**
  - Data preprocessing and feature extraction for IDS.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `TensorFlow`for Deep Learning Models
  - `OpenCV` for image processing
  - `Tesseract OCR` for text extraction
  - `Scikit-learn` for ML utilities
  - `Folium` for plotting attack locations
  - `Streamlit` for the UI
- **Datasets:**
  - **CIC-IDS2017** for intrusion detection
  - **Steganographic Image Dataset** for CNN training
